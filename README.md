Wish me luck!

Made a rough sketch of what I want my website to look like. Really helps to better visualize what needs to be in its own `<div>` or `<section>`

Have started setting up basic skeleton on website. So far so good. Have a nav. bar, multiple sections, 1 card so far!

Okay, I have everything but an unordered list. Will add that later. Going to add content and then move onto CSS.

Page content finished! Now to add the CSS!

Have been working on this assignment for hours. But most of the item on my checklist have been done! Still trying to make everything wrap properly.

Found out what my spacing issue was... I didn't close off one of my links and it was missing everything up...
- Would not have known what was wrong if it wasn't for Ashlyn pushing me to use the dev tools in Firefox. 
  
- Ended up changing card layout to a `grid` layout instead of a `flex` layout. Easier for wrapping. 

Finished at last :D Nothing fancy but it works, It looks nice. Best of all, its responsive.
